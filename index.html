			<h1>Functional Music to Improve</h1>
			<h2>Focus in 15 Minutes</h2>
			<p>Our science-first approach creates music that sounds different-and affects your brain differently-than any other music.</p>

				<h3>Patented Technology</h3>
				<p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit string neural phase locking-allowing populations of nuerons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.</p>
				<p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you in to a desired mental stat. In other words, we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

				<h3>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h3>
				<p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiements</p>
				<p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.</p>
				<p>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo') of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</p>
